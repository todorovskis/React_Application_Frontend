/*
     axios.create is essentially a factory to create new instances of Axios.
     Letâ€™s say you want two instances of Axios: one to call service A and
     another to call service B, where A can work with a timeout of 100ms
     and B needs a timeout of 500ms. This is easily possible with
     axios.create.
